# QR-Scanner-Android

In this work, two applications were developed, one for smartwatches running WearOS operating system and one for Android smartphones. The current work aims at pointing out the QR code (Quick Response Code) technology and its utility in the process of identification of users towards their right to entry an event. Using a QR code, it is possible to save, encode and consequently verify a person’s credentials to give permission of entrance in a place or event promptly and safely.

Therefore, in this project, the application “My QR Pass” was initially designed to operate as a digital wallet for smartwatches in which users can sign-in to their service provider system in which they hold an account and virtually save a QR code containing their personal credentials. Accordingly, the application “QR Scanner” was developed for Android smartphones providing a QR scanner with which users (organizers) can scan and validate a QR code and thus give a client permission of entrance.

The current work addresses challenges that are inherent in developing applications for smartwatches and mobiles, such as a friendly, fast, and attractive user interface. It also manages key issues such as retaining users’ data secure and ensuring their fast and efficient storage and retrieval.
